# Fraud-Detection
# Overview
This project aims to develop robust and accurate fraud detection models. he models are designed to enhance the detection of fraudulent transactions for e-commerce and bank credit transactions. The solution leverages machine learning models, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to improve fraud detection accuracy.
# Project Objectives
 Build accurate fraud detection models for two types of data:
  - E-commerce transactions 
  - Credit card transactions 
- Improve fraud detection using:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Geolocation analysis (IP â†’ country)
  - Advanced machine learning models
  - Explainable AI techniques
- Minimize **false positives** (legit transactions flagged as fraud) and **false negatives** (fraud not detected)
